Abhimanyu.sh — System v1.3.5 🚀

Welcome to the source code of my digital headquarters.
Based in Lucknow, India, I build things that think, scale, and solve real-world problems.

"Code doesn’t lie — it only reveals how clearly you think."

🛠 The Architecture
This project follows a Multi-Page Architecture (MPA) with a focus on performance, responsiveness, and "high-tech" aesthetics.
Logic Engine: Vanilla JavaScript for high-speed DOM manipulation.
Visual Framework: Tailwind CSS for a utility-first, responsive design.
Live Telemetry: Integrates directly with the GitHub REST API to fetch my latest repository data in real-time.
Transmission Gateway: Powered by EmailJS to handle secure data payloads (messages) without a backend.

✨ Core Systems
1. Unified Navigation
A fixed, glassmorphism-style header that adapts to both desktop and mobile. Features a custom Hamburger Drawer for mobile accessibility and a Theme Engine that syncs with your system preferences.

2. Live GitHub Feed
The "Latest_Commits" section isn't hardcoded. It uses asynchronous JavaScript to pull live data from my GitHub profile, showing the world exactly what I'm working on right now.

3. Professional Path (Timeline)
An alternating vertical timeline that documents my journey.

4. Project Archive
A dedicated gallery using HUD-style SVGs and scanline animations to showcase systems like my "LangChain Search Agent" and "Semantic Matchmaker."

🚀 The DevOps Workflow (CI/CD)

This project is built using a modern Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment pipeline.
Code: Changes are made locally in a JetBrains-optimized environment.
Push: Code is pushed to the main branch on GitHub.
Deploy: GitHub Pages automatically triggers a build and deploys the new version to the live URL within 60 seconds.
